|ingredients|||
|-|-|-|
| raw whole almonds | 200g ||
| hot water | 60ml ||
| salt | 1.5 tsp | non-heaped|
| olive oil | 2 tbsp ||
| pepper | 2 tbsp |||

#### pre-processing
1. brine : 60 ml hot water + 1.5 tsp salt
1. mix brine with almonds till all are coated (take in a bowl -> cover and shake)

#### roasting
1. pre-heat oven to 200 degree celsius
1. spread almonds on a baking tray and put in the oven for 15 min
1. check every 5 min and shuffle a little

#### post-processing
1. put the hot almonds back into a bowl
1. add olive oil and pepper
1. toss well until all the nuts are coated
1. leave almonds to cool in a plate, they'll soak up oil as they cool

#### Notes
1. keep a close watch while roasting, almonds can go from not-crisp to burnt in under 2 min
1. keep a close watch on salt in brine, err on the low side
1. more salt can be added if needed in the post-processing stage
1. single layer in baking tray is not needed if roasting time is increased and close watch is kept
